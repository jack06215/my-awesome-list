### Papers
* [Affine Covariant Feature](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/research/affine/)

This page is focused on the problem of detecting affine invariant features in arbitrary images and on the performance evaluation of region detectors/descriptors.

* [An Improved ORB Algorithm of Extracting and Matching Features](http://www.sersc.org/journals/IJSIP/vol8_no5/12.pdf)

Research paper on improved ORB algorithm, 2012.

* [Pose Tracking from Natural Features on Mobile Phones](https://data.icg.tugraz.at/~dieter/publications/Schmalstieg_142.pdf)

A research paper as suggested from its title.

### CV Course
* [COS 429 - Computer Vision](http://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/fall16/cos429/outline.html)

An archive for CV course from Princeton University.

* [Local Invariant Feature Detectors: A Survey](http://www.eng.auburn.edu/~roppeth/courses/7970%202015A%20AdvMobRob%20sp15/literature/%5B2008%5D%20Local%20Invariant%20Feature%20Detectors-%20A%20Survey.pdf)

An overview of invariant interest point detectors, how they evolved over time, how they work, and what their respective strengths and weaknesses are.

* [Understand homogenous coordinate system](http://www.songho.ca/math/homogeneous/homogeneous.html)

Why homogenous coordinate is needed?

### Development library

* [Theia Lirary](http://www.theia-sfm.org/index.html)

C++ library to provide SfM implementation, haven't personally try it yet but sounds interesting.

* [MATLAB and Octave Functions for Computer Vision and Image Processing](http://www.peterkovesi.com/matlabfns/)

Useful computer vision functions by Peter Kovesi.

* [dlib](http://dlib.net/)

Lightweight library that provide machine learning and computer vision functions. I am currently using this as part of C++ implementation for master project.
